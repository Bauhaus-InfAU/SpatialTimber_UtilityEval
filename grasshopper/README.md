# Grasshopper Components — Setup & Verification Guide

This repository includes several GhPython components for use in Rhino 8. This guide covers the furnisher surrogate component (Phase 7). The combined reward component (Phase 13, planned) will be documented here when implemented.

## Available Components

| Component | Script | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Furnisher surrogate | `surrogate_score.py` | Done (Phase 7) | Predicts furnishability score per room |
| Apartment reader | `apartment_reader.py` | Done (Phase 8) | Loads JSON floor plan into GH geometry |
| Apartment writer | `apartment_writer.py` | Done (Phase 8) | Exports GH geometry to JSON floor plan |
| Combined reward | `reward_score.py` | Planned (Phase 13) | Computes all 3 reward functions + composite |

## Prerequisites

- Rhino 8 installed (with CPython scripting support)
- Internet access (to install packages and download model)
- The `furnisher_surrogate` Python package is published at `https://github.com/Bauhaus-InfAU/SpatialTimber_UtilityEval`
- Trained model checkpoint (`.pt` file) available on W&B at `infau/furnisher-surrogate`

All inference code (`predict.py`, `rasterize.py`, `models.py`) and the GhPython component script (`surrogate_score.py`) are already written and tested via pytest (7 fixture rooms, 7 test cases, all passing).

## How Rhino 8 Python Packaging Works

Rhino 8 bundles a full **CPython 3.9** distribution at `%USERPROFILE%\.rhinocode\py39-rh8\`. The Script Editor terminal and all GhPython components share the **same interpreter and packages** — installing a package once makes it available everywhere.

The GhPython script uses `# r: numpy, Pillow` directives that auto-install these packages on first run. However, two dependencies require manual installation because they cannot be auto-installed:

- **PyTorch** — needs a special `--index-url` that `# r:` does not support (McNeel [RH-75515](https://mcneel.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/RH-75515))
- **furnisher_surrogate** — installed from GitHub, not PyPI

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open **Rhino 8 → Tools → Script Editor**, then open [`install_dependencies.py`](install_dependencies.py) and click the **green Run button** (or press F5). The script installs PyTorch CPU-only and the furnisher_surrogate package, then verifies the installation. Packages already installed are skipped.

This only needs to run **once** per Rhino installation. The output should end with:

```
furnisher_surrogate ... OK
torch 2.x.x ... OK
numpy 1.x.x ... OK
```

### Alternative: Windows terminal

If you prefer, you can install from a regular Windows terminal (cmd or PowerShell) using Rhino's bundled Python directly. Replace `<repo>` with the path to your local clone of this repository:

```
"%USERPROFILE%\.rhinocode\py39-rh8\python.exe" -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
"%USERPROFILE%\.rhinocode\py39-rh8\python.exe" -m pip install numpy Pillow
"%USERPROFILE%\.rhinocode\py39-rh8\python.exe" -m pip install "<repo>[inference]" --no-deps
```

> **Note:** Installing `furnisher_surrogate` from GitHub (`git+https://...`) fails inside Rhino's Script Editor because Rhino's Python subprocess environment does not have git in its PATH on Windows (exit code 3221225794). The script and the commands above both install from the local repo clone instead.

---

## Step 2: Download the Model

The `.pt` checkpoint files are stored as W&B Artifacts (not in the git repo).

### Available models

| Model | Features | Test MAE | Recommended? |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `cnn_v4.pt` | geometry + room type + apartment type | 8.07 | **Yes** — best accuracy, default for verification |
| `cnn_v1.pt` | geometry + room type only | 17.90 | Older baseline, no apartment type |

### Option A: Web UI

1. Go to [wandb.ai/infau/furnisher-surrogate](https://wandb.ai/infau/furnisher-surrogate)
2. Click **Artifacts** in the left sidebar
3. Download the desired model (e.g., `cnn_v4.pt` for production and verification)
4. Place it in a known location, e.g., `C:\Models\cnn_v4.pt`

### Option B: CLI (if wandb is installed)

```
wandb artifact get infau/furnisher-surrogate/cnn-v4:latest --root C:\Models
```

Remember the full path — you will need it in Step 4.

## Step 3: Create the GhPython Component

In Grasshopper:

1. Drag a **GhPython Script** component onto the canvas
2. Right-click the component → **Edit Source** (or double-click)
3. **Delete** the default script content
4. **Paste** the contents of [`surrogate_score.py`](surrogate_score.py) in its entirety
5. **Set up the component inputs** (right-click each input → Rename / Type Hint):

| Input | Name | Type Hint | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1st | `polygon` | Polyline | Room boundary (closed polyline, in meters) |
| 2nd | `door` | Point3d | Door position (point on wall, in meters) |
| 3rd | `room_type` | str | Room type name (see list below) |
| 4th | `apartment_type` | str | Apartment type name (see list below, optional — defaults to "2-Bedroom") |
| 5th | `model_path` | str | Full path to `.pt` file (optional) |

6. **Set up the output:**

| Output | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1st | `score` | Predicted score (float, 0–100) |

### Valid room types

```
Bedroom, Living room, Bathroom, WC, Kitchen, Children 1, Children 2, Children 3, Children 4
```

### Valid apartment types

```
Studio (bedroom), Studio (living), 1-Bedroom, 2-Bedroom, 3-Bedroom, 4-Bedroom, 5-Bedroom
```

If `apartment_type` is left empty, the model defaults to "2-Bedroom" (the most common type).

---

## Step 4: Wire Up Test Rooms

### Option A: Automated (recommended)

Use the test room loader component to create all 7 test rooms from a JSON file:

1. Drag a **GhPython Script** component onto the canvas
2. Paste the contents of [`test_room_loader.py`](test_room_loader.py)
3. Set up the component input: `json_path` (str) — full path to [`test_rooms.json`](test_rooms.json)
4. Set up the component outputs (right-click → Manage Output Parameters):

| Output | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1st | `polygons` | Room boundary polylines (list) |
| 2nd | `doors` | Door positions (list of Point3d) |
| 3rd | `room_types` | Room type strings (list) |
| 4th | `apartment_types` | Apartment type strings (list) |
| 5th | `names` | Room names for labelling (list) |
| 6th | `expected_scores` | Expected cnn_v4 scores (list) |

5. Wire the outputs into the **surrogate_score** component (Step 3) — right-click each input on surrogate_score and set **List Access** so it processes one room per item
6. Connect a **Panel** with the `model_path` to the surrogate_score component

All outputs are parallel lists — item 0 across all lists is room 1, item 1 is room 2, etc.

### Option B: Manual

Create the test rooms by hand in Grasshopper. For each room:
- Draw the **Polyline** with exact vertex coordinates (in meters)
- Place a **Point** at the door position
- Connect a **Value List** or **Panel** with the room type string
- Leave **apartment_type** empty (defaults to "2-Bedroom") — the expected scores below assume this default
- Connect the **model_path** (Panel with the full path to your `.pt` file)
- Read the **score** output

> **Note:** The expected scores below are for `cnn_v4.pt` with `apartment_type` left empty (defaults to "2-Bedroom").

### Room 1: rect_high_bedroom

**Type:** Bedroom

**Polygon vertices** (closed rectangle, 3.52 x 4.46 m):
```
(0.0, 0.0)
(3.5193, 0.0)
(3.5193, 4.4561)
(0.0, 4.4561)
(0.0, 0.0)
```

**Door position:** `(0.0, 3.5475)`

**Expected score (cnn_v4):** 70.02

---

### Room 2: rect_zero_kitchen

**Type:** Kitchen

**Polygon vertices** (closed rectangle, 1.31 x 2.03 m):
```
(19.6169, 0.0)

(16.0242, 1.3265)
(16.0242, 0.0)
```

**Door position:** `(17.0513, 0.0)`

**Expected score (cnn_v4):** 47.43

## Step 5: Verification Checklist

After wiring up all test rooms, compare each output score against the expected values.

| # | Room | Type | Expected | GH Output | Pass? |
|---|------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | rect_high_bedroom | Bedroom | 71.94 | | |
| 2 | rect_zero_kitchen | Kitchen | 0.00 | | |
| 3 | lshape_living | Living room | 58.76 | | |
| 4 | complex_children | Children 2 | 32.85 | | |
| 5 | small_bathroom | Bathroom | 60.00 | | |
| 6 | large_living_high | Living room | 72.33 | | |
| 7 | wc_mid | WC | 60.08 | | |

**Tolerance:** Scores should match within **0.01** of the expected values. If any score differs by more than 0.01, something is wrong — see Troubleshooting below.

**All 7 must pass** before considering the Grasshopper integration verified.

Save the Grasshopper definition as `grasshopper/test_surrogate.gh` once all rooms are wired up and verified.

## Compare with Actual Furnisher Scores

For reference, the actual procedural furnisher scores for these rooms are:

| Room | Surrogate (cnn_v4) | Actual Furnisher | Delta |
|------|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| rect_high_bedroom | 70.02 | 87.8 | -17.8 |
| rect_zero_kitchen | 0.00 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| lshape_living | 86.27 | 50.0 | +36.3 |
| complex_children | 54.64 | 0.0 | +54.6 |
| small_bathroom | 56.86 | 100.0 | -43.1 |
| large_living_high | 93.62 | 100.0 | -6.4 |
| wc_mid | 47.43 | 75.0 | -27.6 |

The surrogate is an approximation — it will not match the procedural furnisher exactly. The purpose of this comparison is to confirm the model produces reasonable scores in the right ballpark, not bit-exact matches.

---

## Model Swapping

To use a newer or different model:

1. Download the new `.pt` file from W&B (e.g., `cnn_v3.pt`, `cnn_v4.pt`)
2. Place it in your models folder
3. Update the `model_path` input on the GhPython component to point to the new file
4. Re-run — the component will load the new model automatically

No code changes are needed. Each `.pt` checkpoint contains all architecture parameters and normalization statistics, so the inference code reconstructs the correct model variant (v1–v4) on the fly. Older checkpoints (v1–v3) that lack apartment type support will simply ignore the `apartment_type` input.

**If `model_path` is left empty**, the code searches for the latest `cnn_*.pt` file in the `models/` directory relative to the installed package location. For most Grasshopper setups, it is simpler to always provide an explicit path.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: furnisher_surrogate` | Package not installed in Rhino's Python | Re-run `pip install` commands from Step 1 in Rhino Script Editor Terminal |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: torch` | PyTorch not installed or wrong index | Re-run `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` |
| `FileNotFoundError: No model found` | `.pt` file not at expected path | Set the `model_path` input to the full path of your `.pt` file (e.g., `C:\Models\cnn_v4.pt`) |
| Score = 0 for all rooms | Coordinates in millimeters instead of meters | All coordinates must be in **meters**. If your Rhino model is in mm, divide by 1000. |
| Score differs from expected by > 0.01 | Wrong model file or corrupted download | The expected test scores in Step 4 are for `cnn_v4.pt` with `apartment_type` empty. Confirm you are using `cnn_v4.pt` and the `apartment_type` input is disconnected. |
| Very slow first prediction (~5-10 sec) | Model loading on first call | Normal — the model is cached after the first call. Subsequent predictions are fast (~100-200 ms). |
