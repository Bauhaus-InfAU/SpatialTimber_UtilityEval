## Project

FurnisherSurrogate — a surrogate model to approximate slow procedural furniture placement scores for use in RL training.

**Repo:** `https://github.com/Bauhaus-InfAU/SpatialTimber_FurnisherSurrogate` (**PUBLIC** — never commit secrets, keys, or credentials)

**Secrets:** Store API keys in `.env` (gitignored). Never hardcode keys in code or tracked files.

## Data

Training data: `../SpatialTimber_DesignExplorer/Furnisher/Apartment Quality Evaluation/apartments.jsonl` (~8k apartments, 46k active rooms, JSONL format).

## Domain Concepts

- **Score (0–100):** furniture placement quality — 90+ excellent, 70–89 good, 40–69 problematic, <40 poor, 0 failed, null = room absent
- **Polygon format:** closed polyline in meters, axis-aligned, counter-clockwise winding order
- **Door:** position as a point on the room's wall

**Type enumerations** — canonical source: `src/furnisher_surrogate/data.py:21–45` (exported via `__init__.py`). Note: the evaluation module (`src/evaluation/apartment.py`, Phase 8) adds **Hallway** as index 9 for circulation checks.

| idx | Room type (surrogate) | | idx | Apartment type |
|-----|-----------------------|-|-----|----------------|
| 0 | Bedroom | | 0 | Studio (bedroom) |
| 1 | Living room | | 1 | Studio (living) |
| 2 | Bathroom | | 2 | 1-Bedroom |
| 3 | WC | | 3 | 2-Bedroom |
| 4 | Kitchen | | 4 | 3-Bedroom |
| 5 | Children 1 | | 5 | 4-Bedroom |
| 6 | Children 2 | | 6 | 5-Bedroom |
| 7 | Children 3 | | | |
| 8 | Children 4 | | | |
| 9 | Hallway *(eval only)* | | | |

## Key Constraint

The surrogate predicts **per-room** scores, not per-apartment. Each room is an independent prediction.

## Naming Convention

Notebooks and reports are prefixed by phase number: `{phase}-{seq}_{name}`. This groups artifacts by phase and sorts them naturally.

- **Notebooks:** `notebooks/{phase:02d}-{seq:02d}_{name}.ipynb` — e.g. `03-01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `03-02_umap_exploration.ipynb`
- **Reports:** `reports/{phase:02d}-{seq:02d}_{name}.{ext}` — e.g. `03-01_eda-findings.ipynb`, `04-01_rasterization-verification.html`
- **Plans:** `plans/{phase:02d}-{name}.md` — e.g. `plans/03-eda.md` (unchanged, already follows this pattern)

- **Tickets:** `tickets/{ID:02d}_{slug}.md` — e.g. `tickets/00_notebook-numbering.md`, `tickets/01_non-orthogonal-rooms.md`

When creating a new notebook, report, or ticket, use the next available sequence number.

## Status

Phases 1–8 complete (57/88 tasks). See `PLAN.md` for full progress.

**Data pipeline**: `data.py` loads 8,322 apartments / 45,880 active rooms via `load_apartments()`. 7 apartment types: Studio (bedroom), Studio (living), 1-Bedroom through 5-Bedroom. Frozen `Room`/`Apartment` dataclasses with `apartment_type_idx` field, SHA-256 integrity manifest, apartment-level stratified split (80/10/10). `features.py` extracts 21 features (5 numeric + 9 room_type one-hot + 7 apt_type one-hot), pure numpy. No processed-data caching — JSONL re-parsed each call (~2-3 sec).

**EDA findings** (see `reports/03-01_eda-findings.ipynb`): bimodal scores (28.6% fail at 0, 41.6% score >=90), area is strongest predictor (r=+0.37), door position has zero linear signal, naive MAE=37.48, inter-room correlation near zero (r=0.006). Children rooms cap at ~76. Vertex count strongly predicts score (8-vertex median=37 vs 4-vertex median=92).

**Apartment type EDA** (see `reports/03-03_apartment_type_eda.ipynb`): Living room has large effect (eta-sq=0.19, +56 pt median delta), Kitchen medium effect (eta-sq=0.11, +25 pt delta). 35% of geometry-matched groups show significant differences. Kitchen failure rate doubles from 23% (small apts) to 49% (large apts). Living room failure: 0% (Studio) to 31% (5-Bedroom).

**Baseline model** (LightGBM, 21 features): Test MAE=8.24 (78% improvement over naive 37.48, 25% improvement over 14-feature baseline), R²=0.89. Kitchen MAE: 11.14 (was 16.89), Living room: 8.39 (was 18.84). apt_type features rank 7th-10th by importance. Model saved at `models/baseline_lgbm.joblib`.

**CNN model** (Phase 6): Four versions trained (v1→v2→v3→v4). v4 adds apt_type embedding (4-dim for 7 types). MAE: 17.90→12.40→11.23→8.07. CNN v4 slightly beats LightGBM 21f (8.07 vs 8.24) — wins 6/9 room types, loses on WC and Children 3. Difference is small; LightGBM remains production model for simplicity. Best checkpoint at `models/cnn_v4.pt`.

**Grasshopper integration** (Phase 7, complete): `predict_score()` inference API with `apartment_type` parameter. Backward-compatible with pre-apt-type checkpoints. GhPython component verified end-to-end in Rhino 8. `test_rooms.json` (7 rooms, real cnn_v4 expected scores) + `test_room_loader.py` GhPython component for automated test setup. 7 pytest tests passing.

**Floor plan representation** (Phase 8, complete): `src/evaluation/` package with `ApartmentLayout`, `RoomLayout`, `WallSegment` frozen dataclasses + `load_rules()`. All scoring parameters in `src/evaluation/rules/*.json` (4 files: circulation, daylight, furnishability, composite) — no hardcoded rule dicts in Python. `SCORING.md` is full spec (logic/policy separation rationale, BFS algorithm, composite formula). 5 hand-crafted fixtures in `tests/fixtures/apartments/hand_crafted.json` (H01–H05) validated against JSON schema. `tests/fixtures/apartments/README.md` spec for Luyang. `plans/12-circulation.md` updated: BFS-distance model replaces old reachability model; entrance-room fallback for no-Hallway apartments. Two GhPython utilities: `apartment_reader.py` (JSON→GH geometry) and `apartment_writer.py` (GH geometry→JSON). H02 round-trip verified in Rhino. Apartment JSON validator at `src/evaluation/validate.py`: checks schema, polygon closure, entrance-on-boundary, door-touches-2-rooms, degenerate area; 0.3 m tolerance; CLI entry point. Pytest self-test at `tests/test_validate.py` (parametrized pass tests for H01–H05 + 7 mutation fail tests). Full documentation: [`src/evaluation/VALIDATE.md`](src/evaluation/VALIDATE.md).

## Reports

Reports from completed phases live in `reports/`. Check these before starting new phases — they contain data distribution boundaries, baselines, and known limitations. HTML exports are viewable via `htmlpreview.github.io` — use these preview links in Notion and plan files.

| Tasks | `collection://12d02b87-4c68-8126-a0dc-000bc9955625` |
| Sprints | `collection://2fc02b87-4c68-8029-a5b5-000bfc4f15a2` |

- **WP2 page:** `2f802b874c688070985bfa3f34938c50`
- **Martin (user):** `user://4e65cb83-7da9-47b5-aa9b-76a0c47a4b48`
- Use Notion MCP tools to read/update. Tasks are created in the Tasks data source with `Project` relation pointing to WP2.
- **Linking convention:** When referencing repo files in Notion (task descriptions, project pages), always use full GitHub URLs so readers can click through — e.g. `[plans/03-eda.md](https://github.com/Bauhaus-InfAU/SpatialTimber_FurnisherSurrogate/blob/main/plans/03-eda.md)`, not bare backtick paths.
- **HTML report links:** For HTML reports in `reports/`, use `htmlpreview.github.io` preview URLs instead of raw GitHub links. Pattern: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Bauhaus-InfAU/SpatialTimber_FurnisherSurrogate/blob/main/reports/{filename}.html`. Use these in Notion task Deliverables tables and in plan file Outcome sections.

## Notebook Collaboration

When a Jupyter notebook is open in VS Code with a running kernel, Claude can execute code directly in the kernel via `mcp__ide__executeCode`. This means Claude can inspect variables, check shapes, and run follow-up analysis interactively — no need for save-and-read roundtrips. User runs cells normally; Claude reads/writes to the same kernel.

## Documentation Protocol

This project uses a strict "single source of truth" documentation strategy. When the user says **"document"** (or invokes `/document`), follow these rules:

### File roles — each fact lives in ONE place

| File / System | Contains | Update frequency |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| `README.md` | Project description, data format, setup instructions | At milestones only |
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | Current project state, conventions, key findings | End of each session |
| `PLAN.md` | Strategy, checkboxes, decisions with rationale | As work progresses |
| W&B | All experiment metrics, loss curves, model artifacts (use `wandb.summary` for scalars, `wandb.Table` for breakdowns, `commit=False` to batch) | Automatic during training |
| Notebooks | Self-contained analyses (EDA, training) | During analysis work |
| `reports/` | Phase findings reports (narrative notebooks + HTML) | At phase completion |
| Notion (WP2 + Tasks) | Project scope, high-level task status & descriptions | When documenting |
| `tickets/*.md` | Deferred features, bugs, improvements — backlog parking lot | As noticed |

### What to update when documenting

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Update the Status section and add any new findings/conventions:
   - What was implemented or changed this session
   - Key findings that affect future work
   - New conventions or gotchas discovered
   - Keep total file under ~50 lines

2. **Phase plans** (`plans/*.md`) — Update task checkboxes:
   - Mark `- [ ]` → `- [x]` for completed tasks
   - Add/remove tasks if scope changed
   - Add brief decision notes in Decisions Log sections

3. **PLAN.md** — Sync the global progress table:
   - Count done/total from each phase plan's `## Tasks` section
   - Update `Tasks` column (e.g., `3/5`), `Status` column (`pending` / `in progress` / `done`)
   - Update the `Total` row
   - Phase plans are source of truth; PLAN.md progress table is derived

4. **README.md** — Only update if project scope or setup changed:
   - New dependencies added
   - New setup steps required
   - Project description evolved

5. **Notion WP2 project page** (`2f802b874c688070985bfa3f34938c50`) — Sync with repo state:
   - Update the Approach / Outcome sections if scope or strategy changed
   - Update the Summary property to reflect current project state
   - Keep content concise — Notion is for team-facing overview, not implementation detail

6. **Notion Tasks** (in Tasks data source) — Sync status with `plans/*.md`:
   - Fetch each WP2 task; update `Status` property to match phase progress (Not Started → In Progress → Done)
   - If a task's scope changed, update its page content using the **task description template** (see below)
   - All repo file references must be clickable GitHub links (see Notion linking convention above)
   - Phase plans (`plans/*.md`) are source of truth; Notion task status is derived

### Notion task description template

Every WP2 task page uses this structure:

```
## Goal
{One sentence: what problem this solves and why it matters.}

## Approach
{2-3 sentences: method and key technical decisions. For pending tasks, prefix with "Not started. Planned approach:"}

## Deliverables
| Type | Artifact |
|------|----------|
| {Report / Tool / Model / Dataset / Notebook / Component / Config} | {name + GitHub link} |

## Conclusions
{Bullet list of findings that matter beyond this task — things downstream tasks or other WPs need to know.
For pending tasks: state key open questions + carry forward relevant conclusions from predecessor tasks under "From [Phase] (inputs to this task):"}

## References
- **Plan:** {link to plans/*.md}
- **Depends on:** {Notion link to predecessor task(s)}
- **Feeds into:** {Notion link to successor task(s)}
```

**Deliverable types**: Report, Tool, Model, Dataset, Notebook, Component, Config
**Conclusions are forward-looking** — not a recap of what was done, but what the next person needs to know

7. **Decision Log** — Every plan file (`plans/*.md`) and `PLAN.md` must have a `## Decisions Log` section.
   - When implementing a phase, add an entry for each significant decision made.
   - Decisions include: approach chosen, alternative rejected, scope change, key constraint discovered.
   - Format: `- **<Short title>** (YYYY-MM-DD): <1–2 sentences.>`
   - The Decision Log in `PLAN.md` documents WP-wide scope decisions only.

8. **Tickets** (`tickets/*.md`) — Review open tickets:
   - Mark resolved tickets as `Status: resolved` if the issue was fixed during this session
   - If a ticket was addressed as part of a phase task, note which one
   - Do NOT create tickets during `/document` — tickets are created ad-hoc when issues are noticed

### Tickets (`tickets/`)

Lightweight backlog for features, bugs, and improvements noticed mid-session that should not interrupt current work. Template: `tickets/_TEMPLATE.md`.

- **Naming:** `tickets/{ID}_{slug}.md` — sequential zero-padded ID + kebab-case slug, e.g. `tickets/01_non-orthogonal-rooms.md`
- **When to create:** User says "ticket this", "note this for later", "park this", or you encounter a non-blocking issue during implementation
- **When NOT to create:** If the issue blocks current work — fix it now instead
- **Fields:** Type (feature/bug/improvement/tech-debt), Priority (low/medium/high), Status (open/in-progress/resolved), Phase link, Context, Description, Acceptance Criteria
- **Lifecycle:** open → in-progress → resolved. Resolved tickets stay in the folder (git history) but get marked

### What NOT to duplicate

- Experiment metrics → W&B only
- Analysis results → notebooks only
- Data format details → README.md only (this file just links to it)
- Code explanations → code comments only
